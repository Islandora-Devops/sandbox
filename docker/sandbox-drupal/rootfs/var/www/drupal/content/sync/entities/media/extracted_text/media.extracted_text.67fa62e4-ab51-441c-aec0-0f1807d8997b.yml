      Visualizing Fedora­managed TEI and MEI documents within Islandora<br />
      The Early Modern Songscapes (EMS) project [1] represents a development partnership between the University of Toronto<br />
      Scarborough’s Digital Scholarship Unit (DSU), the University of Maryland, and the University of South Carolina. Developers,<br />
      librarians and faculty from both institutions have collaborated on an intermedia online platform designed to support the<br />
      scholarly investigation of early modern English song. The first iteration of the platform, launched at the Early modern<br />
      Songscapes Conference, held February 8­9, 2019 at the University of Toronto’s Centre for Reformation and Renaissance<br />
      Studies, serves Fedora­held Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) documents through a JavaScript<br />
      viewer capable of being embedded within the Islandora digital asset management framework. The viewer presents versions of<br />
      a song’s musical notation and textual underlay followed by the entire song text.<br />
      This article reviews the status of this technology, and the process of developing an XML framework for TEI and MEI editions<br />
      that would serve the requirements of all stakeholder technologies. Beyond the applicability of this technology in other digital<br />
      scholarship contexts, the approach may serve others seeking methods for integrating technologies into Islandora or working<br />
      across institutional development environments.<br />

      Introduction<br />
      Early Modern Songscapes (EMS) is an interdisciplinary web project co­developed by the University of Toronto Scarborough’s<br />
      Digital Scholarship Unit (DSU), the University of Maryland (including the Maryland Institute for technology in the Humanities), and<br />
      the University of South Carolina. EMS, “aims to develop an intermedia online platform to support scholarly investigations early<br />
      modern English song,” by “tracing individual lyrics and musical settings that moved through different textual and performance<br />
      contexts in sixteenth­ and seventeenth­century England.” Ultimately, the group has goals to build a community and resource for<br />
      researchers and performers interested in sixteenth and seventeenth century English song. The researchers driving the project are<br />
      Katie Larson, from the UTSC English Department, Scott Trudell from the University of Maryland and Sarah Williams from the<br />
      University of South Carolina. The first iteration of the project focused on Henry Lawes’s 1653 Ayres and Dialogues, highlighting<br />
      versions of the songs that have been published, co­located with image and sound materials relating to each individual song. [2]<br />
      Ultimately, Henry Lawes’s work provided a reasonable starting point for study by virtue of scope, availability, and significance of his<br />
      work. However, the hope is that the corpus will grow (and the openness of the project to collaboration is reflected in the absence of<br />
      a strict scope for content).<br />
      At the UTSC Digital Scholarship Unit (DSU), developers and librarians collaborate on the creation of a shared software platforms<br />
      on which projects like EMS can be developed. Uniquely among the DSU’s past projects, EMS incorporated off­site development of<br />
      a viewer that would display TEI/MEI delivered from the library’s Islandora­based infrastructure.<br />
      <br />
      Project Infrastructure<br />
      Islandora is an open­source software framework that combines Fedora’s repository architecture with the flexibility of Drupal and<br />
      Apache Solr. Islandora developers provide Drupal modules that, when installed with their dependencies, allow users to manage,<br />
      create, and access Fedora repository items (digital objects comprised of files, or datastreams) in a Drupal interface. Core indexing<br />

      The Code4Lib Journal – Visualizing Fedora-managed TEI and MEI documents within Islandora<br />
      <br />
      functions are provided through Islandora­specific modules that provide custom integration with Apache Solr. The software is often<br />
      used to support digital collections and preservation, with “utility” modules providing enrichment functions such as annotation.<br />
      As Fedora repository software stores any form of XML inside repository objects, this software has been used in several TEI<br />
      projects and other applications have been built to integrate the TEI into Islandora (Stapelfeldt & Moses, 2013). The wysiwyg TEI<br />
      editor “CWRC writer” [3]< has been integrated into Islandora through the The Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory [4] and<br />
      projects like the “Islandora Critical Edition Solution Pack” [5] through the Editing Modernism in Canada Project [6] incorporate TEI<br />
      features.<br />
      The Early Modern Songscapes (EMS) project made substantial use of existing utility modules in Islandora for storage and display.<br />
      The Islandora XML Solution pack, which makes possible the storage of XML files, enabled the project to store TEI and MEI assets<br />
      produced by project researchers. [7] The project also used a module called Islandora Context [8] which itself extends the<br />
      functionality of the Drupal Context [9] module. The context module is very useful in this instance as it permits for the execution of<br />
      code given particular user or environmental conditions. In the case of EMS, the “Context” is when an XML object is viewed in the<br />
      repository, and the executed code is a JavaScript­based “Edition Viewer,” authored by Raffaele Viglianti at the Maryland Institute<br />
      for Technology in the Humanities at the University of Maryland. Digital Scholarship Unit developer Natkeeran Ledchumykanthan<br />
      the provided an additional EMS integration module (DSU, 2019) [10]. The EMS Integration module includes a context for use with<br />
      the Islandora Context module, providing a way for the Edition Viewer Javascript bundle to be loaded only when viewing XML<br />
      objects.<br />
      <br />
      XML Data Structures & Academic Requirements of the project<br />
      The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) [11] is an extensible, XML­based markup language for the representation of texts. The Music<br />
      Encoding Initiative (MEI) [12] mirrors this work to create markup language for music, but does not have a formal relationship to<br />
      TEI. These two XML formats both apply descriptive markup principles to text and musical text encoding, which privilege semantic<br />
      descriptions (i.e. what some text is) over procedural ones (i.e. how some text looks). Both TEI and MEI were required for this<br />
      project, as the Lawes’s book that formed the initial corpus for the EMS project is at the nexus of literature and music and pays<br />
      careful attention to both the literary and musical aspects of the songs. In the digital editions produced by the project, the TEI is<br />
      used for verse and the MEI format for notated music. This approach renders both editorial intervention and annotation machine<br />
      readable. Making this information explicit allows for the preservation of editorial scholarship in the Fedora repository as well as the<br />
      development of an interactive publication.<br />
      <br />
      Combining TEI and MEI<br />
      Despite the lack of formal relationship between the two initiatives, schemas in TEI and MEI can be combined, and both formats<br />
      provide elements that make the connection meaningful; namely the <notatedMusic> element in TEI and a number of elements in<br />
      MEI that contain textual data, such as on­staff directives <dir>, poem divisions <verse>, or the more generic <anchoredText>.<br />
      Combining these two formats is becoming a fairly established practice, see for example the Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum [13]<br />
      (Menegozzi 2011: 841­842), but is not without challenges as existing tools and workflows are usually focused on either TEI or MEI.<br />
      The hierarchical nature of these formats also requires one of the two to contain the other or, in other words, take a primary<br />
      position. In EMS, the data model priorities TEI, in part because TEI has a well established metadata header in which<br />
      bibliographical information is stored and this was determined to be desirable. Moreover, the single entry point provided by the TEI<br />
      element <notatedMusic> elements makes it possible to embed separate MEI documents within the TEI using XInclude, [14] a<br />
      W3C recommendation that simplifies the inclusion of XML from multiple sources. See figure 1 for a schematic representation of<br />
      the encoding data model for a song, with TEI including MEI data. The song shown is “When on the Altar of my Hand.” Facsimile<br />
      from Early English Books Online (first published here).<br />

      Early English Books Online, with TEI/MEI data.<br />
      The lyrics underlaid under the music notation are encoded both in the MEI as syllables under notes and again as a TEI­encoded<br />
      verse. This duplication is intentional: subsequent verses, when present, are added after the music notation and follow editorial<br />
      patterns of early modern printing practice, which is best encoded with TEI. More information is available about the editorial<br />
      decisions made by the team. [15]<br />
      Re­encoding the first verse (typically laid under the notation) allows project editors to represent their interpretation of how it may<br />
      appear if separately formatted. Because Early Modern songs are often studied as poetry (i.e. removed, for better or worse, from<br />
      their musical context), this repetition of the first verse may become useful if the text were to be presented without the music.<br />
      <br />
      Collating Versions of Text & Music<br />
      A number of songs in the collection have multiple versions coming from different sources, such as manuscripts or other<br />
      contemporary printed editions, which can be with or without music notation. For these cases, the EMS scholars produced a<br />
      variorum edition that is a presentation of the text that showcases differences across the sources without privileging one over the<br />

      other. Both TEI and MEI are well equipped formats for modeling textual variance, but both assume that one text will be the main<br />
      reading text (often called the ‘base text’) and only variant text will be encoded from other sources. [16] To overcome this apparent<br />
      limitation, the project presents separate combined TEI and MEI documents that represent a collation – a document that lists where<br />
      the differences between the sources of one song are to be located. In practice, this document encodes a set of pointers grouped<br />
      by variant; each pointer refers to one or more element in the source XML documents by simple ID references.<br />

      Listing 1. A TEI apparatus entry with pointers to three source documents<br />
      The example above shows a TEI apparatus entry with pointers to three source documents identified by a witness code (e.g.<br />
      #L638_1). Each pointer resolves to text that the editors consider being a variant of each other. Note that #L638_1 and #C709 are<br />
      grouped by the <rdgGrp> element, which indicates that they “agree” or carry the same text (they resolve to the word “deserted”);<br />
      #BL_53723, on the other hand, carries a different readings of the text (it resolves to the text “forsaken”).<br />
      With this approach, the editors are able to encode, and preserve in Fedora, each source separately to the degree of detail that we<br />
      deem appropriate without worrying about tessellating multiple sources in one place. The applicability of this approach goes beyond<br />
      Early Modern song and has been previously applied to other texts by Viglianti (2016) and is currently being improved and<br />
      documented thanks to EMS and the ongoing Frankenstein Variorum edition (Beshero­Bondar and Viglianti 2018). EMS however, is<br />
      the first project to extend this model to music encoding. [17]<br />

      <br />
      While the XML is stored in the Fedora datastore, the display and interactivity are handled entirely in the front end. A JavaScript<br />
      React/Redux [18] application loads the collation file for a specific song and determines which other source files to request based<br />
      on the pointers contained therein. Only one source (such as a specific manuscript or print) is shown at a time, with highlights<br />
      indicating where the sources diverge. Clicking on these highlights will resolve relevant pointers to the other sources and show the<br />
      different readings. The ‘base’ source can be switched at any time. See Figure 3 for an example of the viewer rendering the<br />
      opening text and musical notation with an expanded musical variant.<br />
      <br />
      Figure 3. A screenshot of the viewer showing a rendering of the opening text and musical notation of “Theseus, O Theseus, hark!<br />
      but yet in vain,” with an expanded musical variant in the bass line of measure 4.<br />
      TEI projects typically perform a lossy transformation into HTML for display, but in this case we are using CETEIcean (Cayless and<br />
      Viglianti 2018), a JavaScript library that registers TEI element as HTML custom elements, thus requiring minimal or no changes to<br />
      the TEI source for display in the browser. For rendering MEI we use Verovio (Pugin 2016) a library that renders MEI into SVG for<br />
      display. Both of these tools offer a solution for rendering these data directly in a user’s browser, thus reducing the need for server­<br />
      side infrastructure for TEI and MEI publications. They also provide isomorphic (that is one­to­one) renderings of the data, which<br />
      allows to manipulate the rendering as if it were the actual underlying data. Given that the EMS data model strongly relies on data<br />
      pointers, these isomorphic representations greatly simplify resolving the pointers: their targets will be easily found also in<br />
      rendering­ready data.<br />
      <br />
      Conclusions / Future directions<br />
      The Early Modern Songscapes (EMS) project demonstrates a mechanism for rendering multi­edition TEI and MEI XML data within<br />
      Islandora. Future work may include overall accessibility of the project site, adding additional songbooks and related resources to<br />
      the repository, as well as providing a means to annotate the audio and video objects, for example, by using the Islandora Web<br />
      Annotation module (DSU, 2018).<br />

      Visualizing Fedora­managed TEI and MEI documents within Islandora<br />
      The Early Modern Songscapes (EMS) project [1] represents a development partnership between the University of Toronto<br />
      Scarborough’s Digital Scholarship Unit (DSU), the University of Maryland, and the University of South Carolina. Developers,<br />
      librarians and faculty from both institutions have collaborated on an intermedia online platform designed to support the<br />
      scholarly investigation of early modern English song. The first iteration of the platform, launched at the Early modern<br />
      Songscapes Conference, held February 8­9, 2019 at the University of Toronto’s Centre for Reformation and Renaissance<br />
      Studies, serves Fedora­held Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) documents through a JavaScript<br />
      viewer capable of being embedded within the Islandora digital asset management framework. The viewer presents versions of<br />
      a song’s musical notation and textual underlay followed by the entire song text.<br />
      This article reviews the status of this technology, and the process of developing an XML framework for TEI and MEI editions<br />
      that would serve the requirements of all stakeholder technologies. Beyond the applicability of this technology in other digital<br />
      scholarship contexts, the approach may serve others seeking methods for integrating technologies into Islandora or working<br />
      across institutional development environments.<br />

      Introduction<br />
      Early Modern Songscapes (EMS) is an interdisciplinary web project co­developed by the University of Toronto Scarborough’s<br />
      Digital Scholarship Unit (DSU), the University of Maryland (including the Maryland Institute for technology in the Humanities), and<br />
      the University of South Carolina. EMS, “aims to develop an intermedia online platform to support scholarly investigations early<br />
      modern English song,” by “tracing individual lyrics and musical settings that moved through different textual and performance<br />
      contexts in sixteenth­ and seventeenth­century England.” Ultimately, the group has goals to build a community and resource for<br />
      researchers and performers interested in sixteenth and seventeenth century English song. The researchers driving the project are<br />
      Katie Larson, from the UTSC English Department, Scott Trudell from the University of Maryland and Sarah Williams from the<br />
      University of South Carolina. The first iteration of the project focused on Henry Lawes’s 1653 Ayres and Dialogues, highlighting<br />
      versions of the songs that have been published, co­located with image and sound materials relating to each individual song. [2]<br />
      Ultimately, Henry Lawes’s work provided a reasonable starting point for study by virtue of scope, availability, and significance of his<br />
      work. However, the hope is that the corpus will grow (and the openness of the project to collaboration is reflected in the absence of<br />
      a strict scope for content).<br />
      At the UTSC Digital Scholarship Unit (DSU), developers and librarians collaborate on the creation of a shared software platforms<br />
      on which projects like EMS can be developed. Uniquely among the DSU’s past projects, EMS incorporated off­site development of<br />
      a viewer that would display TEI/MEI delivered from the library’s Islandora­based infrastructure.<br />
      <br />
      Project Infrastructure<br />
      Islandora is an open­source software framework that combines Fedora’s repository architecture with the flexibility of Drupal and<br />
      Apache Solr. Islandora developers provide Drupal modules that, when installed with their dependencies, allow users to manage,<br />
      create, and access Fedora repository items (digital objects comprised of files, or datastreams) in a Drupal interface. Core indexing<br />

      The Code4Lib Journal – Visualizing Fedora-managed TEI and MEI documents within Islandora<br />
      <br />
      functions are provided through Islandora­specific modules that provide custom integration with Apache Solr. The software is often<br />
      used to support digital collections and preservation, with “utility” modules providing enrichment functions such as annotation.<br />
      As Fedora repository software stores any form of XML inside repository objects, this software has been used in several TEI<br />
      projects and other applications have been built to integrate the TEI into Islandora (Stapelfeldt &amp; Moses, 2013). The wysiwyg TEI<br />
      editor “CWRC writer” [3]&lt; has been integrated into Islandora through the The Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory [4] and<br />
      projects like the “Islandora Critical Edition Solution Pack” [5] through the Editing Modernism in Canada Project [6] incorporate TEI<br />
      features.<br />
      The Early Modern Songscapes (EMS) project made substantial use of existing utility modules in Islandora for storage and display.<br />
      The Islandora XML Solution pack, which makes possible the storage of XML files, enabled the project to store TEI and MEI assets<br />
      produced by project researchers. [7] The project also used a module called Islandora Context [8] which itself extends the<br />
      functionality of the Drupal Context [9] module. The context module is very useful in this instance as it permits for the execution of<br />
      code given particular user or environmental conditions. In the case of EMS, the “Context” is when an XML object is viewed in the<br />
      repository, and the executed code is a JavaScript­based “Edition Viewer,” authored by Raffaele Viglianti at the Maryland Institute<br />
      for Technology in the Humanities at the University of Maryland. Digital Scholarship Unit developer Natkeeran Ledchumykanthan<br />
      the provided an additional EMS integration module (DSU, 2019) [10]. The EMS Integration module includes a context for use with<br />
      the Islandora Context module, providing a way for the Edition Viewer Javascript bundle to be loaded only when viewing XML<br />
      objects.<br />
      <br />
      XML Data Structures &amp; Academic Requirements of the project<br />
      The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) [11] is an extensible, XML­based markup language for the representation of texts. The Music<br />
      Encoding Initiative (MEI) [12] mirrors this work to create markup language for music, but does not have a formal relationship to<br />
      TEI. These two XML formats both apply descriptive markup principles to text and musical text encoding, which privilege semantic<br />
      descriptions (i.e. what some text is) over procedural ones (i.e. how some text looks). Both TEI and MEI were required for this<br />
      project, as the Lawes’s book that formed the initial corpus for the EMS project is at the nexus of literature and music and pays<br />
      careful attention to both the literary and musical aspects of the songs. In the digital editions produced by the project, the TEI is<br />
      used for verse and the MEI format for notated music. This approach renders both editorial intervention and annotation machine<br />
      readable. Making this information explicit allows for the preservation of editorial scholarship in the Fedora repository as well as the<br />
      development of an interactive publication.<br />
      <br />
      Combining TEI and MEI<br />
      Despite the lack of formal relationship between the two initiatives, schemas in TEI and MEI can be combined, and both formats<br />
      provide elements that make the connection meaningful; namely the  element in TEI and a number of elements in<br />
      MEI that contain textual data, such as on­staff directives , poem divisions , or the more generic .<br />
      Combining these two formats is becoming a fairly established practice, see for example the Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum [13]<br />
      (Menegozzi 2011: 841­842), but is not without challenges as existing tools and workflows are usually focused on either TEI or MEI.<br />
      The hierarchical nature of these formats also requires one of the two to contain the other or, in other words, take a primary<br />
      position. In EMS, the data model priorities TEI, in part because TEI has a well established metadata header in which<br />
      bibliographical information is stored and this was determined to be desirable. Moreover, the single entry point provided by the TEI<br />
      element  elements makes it possible to embed separate MEI documents within the TEI using XInclude, [14] a<br />
      W3C recommendation that simplifies the inclusion of XML from multiple sources. See figure 1 for a schematic representation of<br />
      the encoding data model for a song, with TEI including MEI data. The song shown is “When on the Altar of my Hand.” Facsimile<br />
      from Early English Books Online (first published here).<br />

      Figure 1. A schematic representation of the encoding data model for the song When on the Altar of my Hand, a Facsimile from<br />
      Early English Books Online, with TEI/MEI data.<br />
      The lyrics underlaid under the music notation are encoded both in the MEI as syllables under notes and again as a TEI­encoded<br />
      verse. This duplication is intentional: subsequent verses, when present, are added after the music notation and follow editorial<br />
      patterns of early modern printing practice, which is best encoded with TEI. More information is available about the editorial<br />
      decisions made by the team. [15]<br />
      Re­encoding the first verse (typically laid under the notation) allows project editors to represent their interpretation of how it may<br />
      appear if separately formatted. Because Early Modern songs are often studied as poetry (i.e. removed, for better or worse, from<br />
      their musical context), this repetition of the first verse may become useful if the text were to be presented without the music.<br />
      <br />
      Collating Versions of Text &amp; Music<br />
      A number of songs in the collection have multiple versions coming from different sources, such as manuscripts or other<br />
      contemporary printed editions, which can be with or without music notation. For these cases, the EMS scholars produced a<br />
      variorum edition that is a presentation of the text that showcases differences across the sources without privileging one over the<br />

      other. Both TEI and MEI are well equipped formats for modeling textual variance, but both assume that one text will be the main<br />
      reading text (often called the ‘base text’) and only variant text will be encoded from other sources. [16] To overcome this apparent<br />
      limitation, the project presents separate combined TEI and MEI documents that represent a collation – a document that lists where<br />
      the differences between the sources of one song are to be located. In practice, this document encodes a set of pointers grouped<br />
      by variant; each pointer refers to one or more element in the source XML documents by simple ID references.<br />

      Listing 1. A TEI apparatus entry with pointers to three source documents<br />
      The example above shows a TEI apparatus entry with pointers to three source documents identified by a witness code (e.g.<br />
      #L638_1). Each pointer resolves to text that the editors consider being a variant of each other. Note that #L638_1 and #C709 are<br />
      grouped by the  element, which indicates that they “agree” or carry the same text (they resolve to the word “deserted”);<br />
      #BL_53723, on the other hand, carries a different readings of the text (it resolves to the text “forsaken”).<br />
      With this approach, the editors are able to encode, and preserve in Fedora, each source separately to the degree of detail that we<br />
      deem appropriate without worrying about tessellating multiple sources in one place. The applicability of this approach goes beyond<br />
      Early Modern song and has been previously applied to other texts by Viglianti (2016) and is currently being improved and<br />
      documented thanks to EMS and the ongoing Frankenstein Variorum edition (Beshero­Bondar and Viglianti 2018). EMS however, is<br />
      the first project to extend this model to music encoding. [17]<br />

      <br />
      While the XML is stored in the Fedora datastore, the display and interactivity are handled entirely in the front end. A JavaScript<br />
      React/Redux [18] application loads the collation file for a specific song and determines which other source files to request based<br />
      on the pointers contained therein. Only one source (such as a specific manuscript or print) is shown at a time, with highlights<br />
      indicating where the sources diverge. Clicking on these highlights will resolve relevant pointers to the other sources and show the<br />
      different readings. The ‘base’ source can be switched at any time. See Figure 3 for an example of the viewer rendering the<br />
      opening text and musical notation with an expanded musical variant.<br />
      <br />
      Figure 3. A screenshot of the viewer showing a rendering of the opening text and musical notation of “Theseus, O Theseus, hark!<br />
      but yet in vain,” with an expanded musical variant in the bass line of measure 4.<br />
      TEI projects typically perform a lossy transformation into HTML for display, but in this case we are using CETEIcean (Cayless and<br />
      Viglianti 2018), a JavaScript library that registers TEI element as HTML custom elements, thus requiring minimal or no changes to<br />
      the TEI source for display in the browser. For rendering MEI we use Verovio (Pugin 2016) a library that renders MEI into SVG for<br />
      display. Both of these tools offer a solution for rendering these data directly in a user’s browser, thus reducing the need for server­<br />
      side infrastructure for TEI and MEI publications. They also provide isomorphic (that is one­to­one) renderings of the data, which<br />
      allows to manipulate the rendering as if it were the actual underlying data. Given that the EMS data model strongly relies on data<br />
      pointers, these isomorphic representations greatly simplify resolving the pointers: their targets will be easily found also in<br />
      rendering­ready data.<br />
      <br />
      Conclusions / Future directions<br />
      The Early Modern Songscapes (EMS) project demonstrates a mechanism for rendering multi­edition TEI and MEI XML data within<br />
      Islandora. Future work may include overall accessibility of the project site, adding additional songbooks and related resources to<br />
      the repository, as well as providing a means to annotate the audio and video objects, for example, by using the Islandora Web<br />
      Annotation module (DSU, 2018).<br />
