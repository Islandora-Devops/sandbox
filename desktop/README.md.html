Requirements
==============================================================

Before you can set up **Islandora Sandbox** locally you must first install a few
software packages.

Docker Desktop
--------------------------------------------------------------

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) provides a
graphical user interface for all major platforms.

<https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop>

Follow the link above and select the appropriate system and follow the
installation instructions.

**If you already have Docker Desktop installed,** make sure that the **Extensions** 
feature is listed in the left sidebar. If it is not, you need to update to the newest 
version of Docker Desktop. This is required to add the Portainer extension.

Portainer Extension
--------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have worker [Docker Desktop](#dockerdesktop) installation, you can add
the [Portainer](https://portainer.io/) extension:

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. From the Dashboard, select Add Extensions in the menu bar.
3. The Extensions Marketplace opens.
4. Browse the available extensions.
5. Select **Portainer**
6. Click Install.

For more information on Portainer refer to its
[documentation](https://docs.portainer.io/).

Setup
==============================================================

Assuming you have all the [Requirements](#requirements) installed
and running. You can now setup **Islandora Sandbox**.

Generate docker-compose.yml
--------------------------------------------------------------

In this package there are some platform specific scripts. Please **double
click** on the appropriate script for your platform:

| Platform  | Script        |
| :-------- | :------------ |
| Linux     | setup.command |
| Macintosh | setup.command |
| Windows   | setup.bat     |
[Table [states]: Platform specific setup script.]

This will install a local certificate and generate a `docker-compose.yml` file.
During execution of the script, you will be **prompted for your admin password**, 
in order to install the local certificate.

Create Stack
--------------------------------------------------------------

Once that has completed successfully, you can open **Portainer** via the Docker
Desktop Dashboard.

1. Open Docker Desktop.
2. Click on Portainer.
3. Open the sidebar.
4. Click on **Stacks**.
5. Click **Add Stack**.
6. Select **Upload from your Computer**.
7. Type in the name **sandbox** (_lowercase_).
8. Upload the **docker-compose.yml** file you generated via the setup script.
9. Click on **Deploy the Stack**.

This may take a **very long** time if this is the first time setting up
**Islandora Sandbox** as it must download all the Docker Images from the
internet.

the following.
